This has been an interest of mine since I was a child. I used to make board games for my sibling and create mechanical devices to understand how things work. Unfortunately, all creations from my childhood had been lost, and I did not keep any pictures of them. </p><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/lego/daytona.jpeg alt=daytona><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/lego/lotr.jpeg alt=lotr><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/lego/ships.jpeg alt=spaceships><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/lego/flower.jpeg alt=flowers></div><div class=cell><h3>Tea brewing</h3><p> I enjoy brewing tea, especially green tea. I find it relaxing and it helps me focus on my research. I can only master three aspects of tea brewing: temperature, time, and the amount of tea leaves. Right porcelains and water quality are the next frontier for me to explore. </p><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/tea.jpeg alt=Reading></div></div><div class=column><div class=cell><h3>Reading</h3><p> My page turning rhythm is that of an interest-driven reader. I read books on science fictions, popular science, mathematics, and cognitive science (not in any particular order of preference). </p><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/books.jpeg alt=Books></div><div class=cell><h3>Gaming</h3><p> Gaming is where I can explore new worlds and experience new stories beyond the life I live. I have played all genres of games. But only in building and automation games that I could invest hundreds of hours into and feel no regret for the time spent. Especially because of the feeling of inspiration before starting, the arduous work during the process, and the satisfaction of seeing the hard-earned final outcomes in these games that make me feel accomplished. </p><p> My unique dyson sphere design from Dyson Sphere Program. </p><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/dsp_dyson.jpeg alt="dyson sphere program"><p> An Asgard inspired powerplant and a functioning Turing machine from Factorio. </p><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/factorio_source.jpeg alt="factorio powerplant"><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/factorio_turing.jpeg alt="factorio functioning turing machine"><p> My bases from VRising, Valheim, and Ark. </p><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/vrising_base.jpeg alt="vrising base"><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/ark_base.jpeg alt="ark base"><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/ark_base_2.jpeg alt="ark base"><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/ark_base_3.jpeg alt="ark base"><img class="decorated " src=./resources/images/games/ark_base_4.jpeg alt="ark base"></div></div></div><div class="footer secondary"><div class=copyright> Designed and developed by myself. &#169 2023 Virie.
