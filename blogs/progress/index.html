This experience reminded me of how we, as humans, strive to make progress within our society. </p><p> When pursuing goals and achievements, it's crucial to consider which endeavors are worthwhile and which are not. </p><p> It's often said that only difficult tasks are worth pursuing. But how do we define difficulty? One possible criterion is the rarity of a task's occurrence. The rarity may stem from either a limited number of ways to achieve the goal, or the probability of success being inherently low for all available paths. </p><p> In the first case, progress is made when we identify the path or even better alternatives. In the second case, simply finding a path or the most optimal one isn't enough; we must also marshal significant resources to generate enough successful outcomes to claim mastery. </p><p> This brings up two important questions: </p><ul><li> What should an individual do? Should they choose an easily achievable goal and focus on finding the most reliable way to reach it, or venture further and seek a path, reliable or otherwise, to attain more challenging objectives? </li><li> Who will garner more acclaim? Those who uncover simple solutions and share them with everyone, or those who can accomplish difficult tasks? </li></ul><hr><ul class=bibliography></ul></div></div><script src=../../libs/svg.min.js></script><script src=../../scripts/viewer.js></script><script src=../scripts/bibliography.js></script></body></html>
