They serve as fundamental components in the realm of mathematical education for us<span class=cite>Polynomials. Brilliant.org. Retrieved 15:25, April 9, 2023, from https://brilliant.org/wiki/polynomials/</span>. Their orthogonal basis properties also enable the independent factorization of their linear combinations, making them an ideal starting point for machine learning practictioners<span class=cite>Sch√∂lkopf, B., Smola, A. J., & Bach, F. (2002). Learning with kernels: support vector machines, regularization, optimization, and beyond. MIT press.</span>. </p><p><t>Nonetheless, manual calculations involving polynomials can be challenging due to the numerous terms we need to jot down and cancel out during arithmetic operations. In this article, I aim to showcase a technique that simplifies polynomial arithmetic from the perspective of convolution<span class=cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution</span>, making it less burdensome for individuals. </p><h2>&#8706 Yet another way to represent polynomials</h2><p class=first> Before delving into the method, let's initially examine the approach to representing polynomials that I find both practical and efficient to work with. </p> From this polynomial \( x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \), I recommend that we simplify it into <div class="virie-algebra-block axes-xy"> {x^2 + 2xy + y^2} </div> Also for \( x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1 \): <div class="virie-algebra-block axes-x1"> {x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1} </div><p> This representation offers a more compact and convenient way to perform convolution. Note that I've omitted the degree component from the individual term, as during polynomial operations, we must define and share the axes among the operands anyway. </p> We can also generalize the representation up to 3 axes in 2D space using simplex. This polynomial \( 1 + 3x - y - 2xy + 2x^2 \) can be written as <div class="virie-algebra-block axes-xy1"> {1 + 3x - y - 2xy + 2x^2 + 0y^2} </div> Now we are ready to proceed. <h2>&#8706 Operations using graph convolution</h2> Performing polynomial muliplication is simply convolution<span class=cite>This is infact cross-correlation. But in machine learning community, they are both interchangeable.</span>, for example: <div class=mathjax> \[ (1 + x - y)(1 + 2x) = 1 + 3x - y - 2xy + 2x^2 \] </div><div class="virie-algebra-block axes-xy1"> {1 + x - y}.{1 + 2x} = {1 + 3x - y - 2xy + 2x^2} </div><p> We simply multiply the coefficients of each term in the first polynomial with the coefficients of each term in the second polynomial, and find the terms with the same degree and add them up. This is the same as performing convolution on the graph representation of the polynomials. </p><p> This is not a new technique. Polynomial multiplication is one of the common examples to show the speed up benefit of discrete fourier transform<span class=cite>https://brilliant.org/wiki/discrete-fourier-transform/#convolution-and-polynomial-multiplication</span>. But our goal is the opposite. Rather than presenting a method that provides speed improvements but is difficult to execute manually, we aim to carry out polynomial operations using pen and paper. </p> Here is my first trick. <div class=kernel> When working with two one-dimensional polynomials, do write the artifact terms diagonally. </div><p> Typically, we convolve with the smaller operand to minimize the working memory used. By organizing the terms diagonally, you can save space, as it only necessitates a number of rows equivalent to the terms in the moving operand. </p><div class=mathjax> \[ (1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5).(1 + x + x^2 + x^3) = (1 + x^2 - x^6 - x^8) \] </div><div class="virie-algebra-block axes-x1"> {1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5}.{1 + x + x^2 + x^3} = {1 + 0x + x^2 + 0x^3 + 0x^4 + 0x^5 - x^6 + 0x^7 - x^8} </div> Polynomial division is merely a game of matching patterns. Finding products that can eliminate all the starting terms. <div> \[ \frac{- 2x^2 + 3x + 2}{2x + 1} = - x + 2 \] </div><div class="virie-algebra-block axes-x1"> {2 + 3x - 2x^2}/{1 + 2x} = {2 - x} </div><div class=mathjax> \[ \frac{- x^8 - x^6 + x^2 + 1}{x^3 + x^2 + x + 1} = {-x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1} \] </div><div class="virie-algebra-block axes-x1"> {1 + 0x + x^2 + 0x^3 + 0x^4 + 0x^5 - x^6 + 0x^7 - x^8}/{1 + x + x^2 + x^3} = {-x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1} </div><p> You may notice that in both examples, I carried out the convolution using varying order sequences. In fact, it's not essential to follow a specific sequence, provided that each bin has been convolved. Unlike the long division method, which requires a left-to-right sequence, you only need to ensure that every bin is accounted for in the convolution process when the quotient is divisible by the denominator. </p><div class=kernel> However, when dealing with remainders, adhering to a sequence from the highest to the lowest degree ensures that you obtain the lowest degree remainder. </div> Here is a multi-variable division using simplexes: <div class=mathjax> \[ \frac{1 + 3x - y - 2xy + 2x^2}{1 + x - y} = 1 + 2x \] </div><div class="virie-algebra-block axes-xy1"> {1 + 3x - y + 2x^2 - 2xy}/{1 + x - y} = {1 + 2x} </div><div class=kernel> When working with simplexes, the best practice is to solve the corners first. </div><div class=mathjax> \[ \frac{1 + 4x - 2y + 5x^2 - 6xy + y^2 - 4x^2y + 2xy^2 + 2x^3}{1 + x - y} = 1 + 3x - y - 2xy + 2x^2 \] </div><div class="virie-algebra-block medium axes-xy1"> {1 + 4x - 2y + 5x^2 - 6xy + y^2 - 4x^2y + 2xy^2 + 2x^3}/{1 + x - y} = {1 + 2x^2 - 2xy - y + 3x} </div><p class=first> By leveraging the human visual cortex for solving polynomial arithmetic, we can take advantage of the consistency in the structure.
