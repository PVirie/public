At each step, the game presents you with paths you may take, but you can stay on one of them. All paths reach the goal, but some paths are longer than others, which represent the cost to reach the goal when taking that path. The path's details are hidden from you, but you can see the "estimated" value of taking that path, the higher the better. The game ends when you reach the goal. </p><div class="state-diagram flow-horizontal"> { "node": "c", "transitions": { "V(s)": { "node": "s" }, "V(u)": { "node": "u" } } } </div><p> Here is the catch. At each step, you see nothing else but the next path choices you may take and their associated values. You don't know how many steps are there in each path, you don't know what the other steps are, therefore you cannot plan ahead. Sadly, there's nothing you can do but choosing the path that has the highest estimated value. Rational, but bounded, you are. </p><p> The reason why I discuss this game with you is because it is a good example of a situation where you have to make a decision without knowing the whole picture. In fact, this is the situation we face everyday. When presented with choices and uncertainty, we cannot do better than choosing the best choice available. If the path we took happens to be the best, we are lucky. If not, we waste our time and resource, and even worse we have to go back and start over. </p><p> I'm allured to discuss that we could be better if the estimated values of the paths are not over claiming their goodness. </p><h2>&#8706 When the choices do not over claim their goodness</h2><p class=first> In other words, what could we achieve if the values are humble? </p> Suppose that \(V_s\) is the value of path \(s\), \(V^*_s\) is the underlying value of path \(s\), and \(h_s\) is the humility of path \(s\). The value of the path is the underlying value of the path minus the humility of the path. <div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} V_s &= V^*_s - h_s \end{align*} $$ </div> If we pick \(s\), then the value of the path is highest than any path, say \(u\). <div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} V_s &\gt V_u \\ V^*_s - h_s &\gt V^*_u - h_u \\ V^*_s - V^*_u &\gt h_s - h_u \end{align*} $$ </div><div class=mathjax> $$ \text{if} \; h_s - h_u \gt 0 \; \text{then} \; V^*_s - V^*_u \gt 0 $$ </div><p> That is, if the choice we made is more humble and yet its value is still higher than the other paths, then the underlying value of the path we choose is surely higher than the other choices. </p><p> Eventhough, we got the best path. But contingency is not always on our side. Sometimes, humility might interfere with the path in the future, and we might end up choosing a worse path. What are conditions that guarantee that we will not choose a worse path again? </p><p> Suppose that the value of each step, say \(n\), is governed by the geometric diminishing pattern. </p><div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} V^*(n) &= \gamma V^*(n + 1) \\ &= \gamma^2 V^*(n + 2) \\ & \ldots \\ &= \gamma^{N-n} 1 \\ &= \gamma^{N-n} \end{align*} $$ </div> where \(N\) is the number of steps in the path, and \(0 \lt \; \gamma \lt 1\) is the discount factor. <p> We can guarantee that we will not pick a worse path again if ... </p><h2>&#8706 Humility is always a fraction of the path's value</h2><div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} h(n) = \alpha.\gamma^{N-n} \end{align*} $$ </div><p> It can be shown that if we already got the best path, the values of all steps in the future of our path are always higher than the values of the other paths. </p><div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} V_s(n) &\gt V_u(n) \\ V^*_s(n) - h_s(n) &\gt V^*_u(n) - h_u(n) \\ V^*_s(n) - V^*_u(n) &\gt h_s(n) - h_u(n) \\ \gamma^{N_s-n} - \gamma^{N_u-n} &\gt h_s(n) - h_u(n) \\ \gamma^{-k}[\gamma^{N_s-n} - \gamma^{N_u-n}] &\gt \gamma^{-k}[h_s(n) - h_u(n)] \\ \gamma^{N_s-n-k} - \gamma^{N_u-n-k} &\gt \gamma^{-k}[h_s(n) - h_u(n)] \\ V^*_s(n + k) - V^*_u(n + k) &\gt \gamma^{-k}[h_s(n) - h_u(n)] \\ V^*_s(n + k) - h_s(n+k) - V^*_u(n + k) - h_u(n+k) &\gt \gamma^{-k}[h_s(n) - h_u(n)] - h_s(n+k) - h_u(n+k) \\ V_s(n + k) - V_u(n + k) &\gt \gamma^{-k}[h_s(n) - h_u(n)] - h_s(n+k) - h_u(n+k) \\ V_s(n + k) - V_u(n + k) &\gt \gamma^{-k}[\alpha_s.\gamma^{N_s-n} - \alpha_u.\gamma^{N_u-n}] - \alpha_s.\gamma^{N_s-n-k} - \alpha_u.\gamma^{N_u-n-k} \\ V_s(n + k) - V_u(n + k) &\gt \alpha_s.\gamma^{N_s-n - k} - \alpha_u.\gamma^{N_u-n - k} - \alpha_s.\gamma^{N_s-n-k} - \alpha_u.\gamma^{N_u-n-k} \\ V_s(n + k) - V_u(n + k) &\gt 0 \\ V_s(n+k) &\gt V_u(n+k) \end{align*} $$ </div><p> I.e., to guarantee consistency when selecting a path, the humility of each path must be a fraction of the path's value. </p><h2>&#8706 How much humility is enough?</h2><p> In the end, we want to get the path that has the highest underlying value. Humility may not make thing worse, but too much humility may make us miss the best path. Just how much humility we can afford to have? in order to make sure that the suboptimal paths will not be selected. </p><p> Suppose that the optimal path \(s\) is being compared with the suboptimal path \(u\). The path \(s\) has \(N_s\) steps, and the path \(u\) has \(N_u = N_s + k\) steps. The difference of the paths' underlying values follows this formula: </p><div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} V^*_s(n) - V^*_u(n) &= \gamma^{N_s - n} - \gamma^{N_u - n} \\ &= \gamma^{N_s - n} - \gamma^{N_s + k - n} \\ &= \gamma^{N_s - n}[1 - \gamma^k] \\ &= V^*_s(n)[1 - \gamma^k] \\ \end{align*} $$ </div><p> In the close case where \(k=1\), humility should be no more than \(h = V^* - V^*(1-\gamma) = V^*\gamma \). </p><hr><ul class=bibliography></ul></div></div><script src=../../libs/svg.min.js></script><script src=../scripts/bibliography.js></script><script src=../expectation/graphic.js></script><script src=../../scripts/viewer.js></script><script src=../../scripts/active.js></script><script src=../scripts/weblog.js></script></body></html>
