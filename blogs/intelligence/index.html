But not just only after the advent of the computers, that we have thought about intelligence. Before that, intelligence has always been a subject of advancement, investment, and great historical interest. Along with curiosity, we use it to expore from the immeasurable extent of the universe to the tiniest space between particles. Along with bravery, we equip it and land ourselves on the moon. Along with pride, we decorate our bank notes not with the faces of our strongest but the brightest. Intelligence is perhaps unarguably the most revered trait of human beings. </p><p> But what is intelligence? How do we measure it? In this blog, I would like to present my perspective on the matter; and, if you would indulge me, provide a definition of intelligence and how to measure it. </p><h2>&#8706 Definition of intelligence</h2> Let's start with perhaps the most famous definition of intelligence<span class=cite>Legg, S., & Hutter, M. (2007). Universal intelligence: A definition of machine intelligence. Minds and machines, 17, 391-444.</span>: <div class=quote><p class=first>Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments</p><h3>Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter</h3></div> There are several questions that arise from this definition. <h3>What if we consider the receiving reward instead of goals?</h3><p> This is often the case in reinforcement learning<span class=cite>Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (2018). Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT press.</span> where the agent is trained to maximize some reward function. Suppose that there is an agent that always miss its goals but still manage to achieve an overall high rewards. Even though the agent can achieve high rewards, the agent has failed to control its surrounding to get what it wants. Is this agent considered intelligent in this case? Or better, does the agent have full autonomy of its actions at all? </p><h3>Can agents without goals be intelligent?</h3><p> This is related to the previous question. Because, we cannot distinguish between a random agent that reaches a certain state and an agent that reaches the same state without a purpose, we cannot assure that the agent has the control of itself. Trying to measure intelligence of something without knowing its goal is the same as asking why thing is. Lest everything that is is considered intelligent in its own way, and makes the definition of intelligence meaningless; it does not appeal to measure the intelligence of something that we cannot know it motive. </p><h3>How wide of the range of environments for intelligence measure to be meaningful?</h3><p> In the definition, the range of environments should be wide. But how wide is wide? Can we say that a person is intelligent if they can only achieve goals in a limited range of environments? Or can we say that a person is intelligent if they can achieve goals in a wide range of environments but only with a low success rate? Which is more intelligent? Is it fair to compare them at all? </p><p> From the analysis of these questions, we know that </p><ul><i> we should not consider the agent intelligent based on rewards, </i><i> intelligence is only meaningful when we know the purpose or the desire to achieve goals of the agent, and </i><i> the amount of intelligence depends on in which environment the agent performs. </i></ul> With respect to these points, I propose the following definition of intelligence: <div class=kernel> Intelligence is the context-dependent ability to have things for purpose and the capability to get them. </div><p> This definition entails the idea that intelligence is not just about achieving goals but also about the wanting to achieve them in the first place. It also incorporates the idea that intelligence is context-dependent. This means that intelligence is not something we can trivially compare between agents with different interest and within different contexts. </p><p> But suppose that we cautiously prepare everything for the sake of measuring intelligence. How can we actually measure it? </p><h2>&#8706 Measuring intelligence</h2><p class=first> The straightforward way to measure anything is via a control trial (RT). For intelligence, we measure the rate that an agent can act to get what it wants. </p><p> Given an intelligence measure trial as a sequence of a start state and a goal tuple \((s, g)\), we let an agent that we want to measure its intelligence to find a means to achieve the goal from the start state. Suppose that each tuple, the agent ends with success rate of \( \mathcal{V}^{g}(s) \). Then the agent's <it>proficiency</it> \( \mathcal{P} \) to attain the goal is defined as the expected success rate of achieving the goal from all starting states: </p><div class="kernel mathjax"> $$ \begin{align*} \mathcal{P}(g) \triangleq E\left[\mathcal{V}^{g}(s)\right] \end{align*} $$ </div> Let's defined this again in the measure theory<span class=cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space</span> vernacular. Given a measure space (M, S, P) that we want to measure intelligence, where <ul><li> M is the set of all possible states (or the cognitive map), </li><li> S is the set of all possible events (in this case, it's the set of all start state sets \(\{ \{s_0\}, \{s_1\}, \ldots\}\)), </li><li> P is the probability measure of state importance (as some states may be more important or appear more frequently than others). </li></ul> Then the proficiency can be defined as the Lebesgue integral of the success rate function over the cognitive map: <div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} E\left[\mathcal{V}^{g}(s)\right] = \int_{M} \mathcal{V}^{g}(s) d P \end{align*} $$ </div> I always find it easier to grasp the above equation when thinking of \( \mathcal{V} \) as a collection of neurons \( \nu_i \) that each activates when the designated state \( s_i \) is given<span class=cite>Cybenko, G. (1989). Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function. Mathematics of control, signals and systems, 2(4), 303-314.</span>: <div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} \mathcal{V}^{g}(s) = \nu^{g}_0\chi_0(s) + \nu^{g}_1\chi_1(s) + \ldots \end{align*} $$ </div> where \( \chi_i \) is the characteristic function of the set \( S_i \) that is 1 if the state is in \( S_i \) and 0 otherwise. Then the proficiency can be intepreted as the weighted sum of the neuron activations over the cognitive map: <div class=mathjax> $$ \begin{align*} \int_{M} \mathcal{V}^{g}(s) d P = \nu^{g}_0\mu(S_0) + \nu^{g}_1\mu(S_1) + \ldots \end{align*} $$ </div> where \( \mu(S_i) \) is the size of the state group \( S_i \) that all of its members have the same success rate. <br><br> Then the intelligence \(\mathcal{I}\) can be defined as the expected value of proficiency over the set of goals \( G \subset M \): <div class="kernel mathjax"> $$ \begin{align*} \mathcal{I} \triangleq E_{g \in G} \left[ \mathcal{P}(g) \right] \end{align*} $$ </div><p> In fact when computing the intelligence, we can ignore the measure space and just weighted sum the success rate of all start state and goal pairs. </p><h2>&#8706 Application to education</h2><p> This definition of intelligence is aligned with what we do in practice; especially, when we exercise tests as the means to measure students cognitive ability, we are actually measuring the success rate of achieving the tests' goals. But more importantly, because intelligence is defined over the desire to achieve goals, this means that any test score can only be justified when the owner test taker is committedly interested in purpose of the test, and not less. </p><p> The goal of educators should therefore not solely be to increase the test scores of students but to increase the students' interest in the subjects. This is because the students' intelligence measure can only be meaningful when they are conscious of the importance of education. </p><h2>&#8706 Final words</h2><p> My entire life has been dedicated to the pursuit of the meaning of intelligence and how to simulate it. I have read many papers and books, and have spent countless hours thinking about it. This post is the culmination of my thoughts on the matter. I hope that this post can be a stepping stone for those who want to understand intelligence even better, and a final closure for those who have been seeking the answer for a long time. </p><hr><ul class=bibliography></ul></div></div><script src=../../libs/svg.min.js></script><script src=../scripts/bibliography.js></script><script src=../../scripts/viewer.js></script><script src=../../scripts/active.js></script><script src=../scripts/weblog.js></script></body></html>
